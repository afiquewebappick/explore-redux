# 💬 Customer Support Zone

## 📝 Project Description

**Customer Support Zone** is a React-based web application designed to simulate a customer service ticket management system. It allows users to view, track, and manage customer support tickets efficiently — from creation to resolution.  
The project follows a structured **Figma design** and demonstrates key React concepts such as **state management**, **event handling**, and **component-based architecture**.

This interactive system helps visualize the flow of support operations, from open tickets to in-progress tasks and finally to resolved issues. It includes responsive design, live status updates, and stylish toast notifications for improved user experience.
